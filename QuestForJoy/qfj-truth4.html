<p><strong>4) All of us are subject to God's just condemnation</strong></p>

<p><em>"The wages of sin is death..."</em> (Romans 6:23)</p>

<p>We have all belittled the glory of God. How? By preferring other things above him. By our ingratitude, distrust and disobedience. So God is just in shutting us out from the enjoyment of his glory forever. "They will suffer the punishment of eternal destruction and exclusion from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his might" (2 Thessalonians 1:9).</p>

<p>The word "hell" is used in the New Testament fourteen times<sup><a href="#hell">1</a></sup> - twelve times by Jesus himself. It is not a myth created by dismal and angry preachers. It is a solemn warning from the Son of God who died to deliver sinners from its curse. We ignore it at great risk.</p>

<p>If the Bible stopped here in its analysis of the human condition, we would be doomed to a hopeless future. However, this is not where it stops...</p>
