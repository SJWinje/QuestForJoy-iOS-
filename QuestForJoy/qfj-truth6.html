<p><strong>6) The benefits purchased by the death of Christ belong to those who repent and trust him</strong></p>

<p><em>"Repent, then, and turn to God, so that your sins may be wiped out"</em> (Acts 3:19). <em>"Believe in the Lord Jesus and you will be saved"</em> (Acts 16:31).</p>

<p>"Repent" means to turn from all the deceitful promises of sin. "Faith" means being satisfied with all that God promises to be for us in Jesus. "He who believes in me," Jesus says, "shall never thirst" (John 6:35). We do not earn our salvation. We cannot merit it (Romans 4:4-5). It is by grace through faith (Ephesians 2:8-9). It is a free gift (Romans 3:24). We will have it if we cherish it above all things (Matthew 13:44). When we do that, God's aim in creation is accomplished: He is glorified in us and we are satisfied in him - forever.</p>

<h4>Does this make sense to you?</h4>

<p>Do you desire the kind of gladness that comes from being satisfied with all that God is for you in Jesus? If so, then God is at work in your life.</p>
