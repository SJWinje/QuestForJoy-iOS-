<p><strong>1) God created us for his glory</strong></p>

<p><em>"Bring my sons from afar and my daughters from the ends of the earth,... whom I created for my glory."</em> (Isaiah 43:6-7)</p>

<p>God made us to magnify his greatness - the way telescopes magnify stars. He created us to put his goodness and truth and beauty and wisdom and justice on display. The greatest display of God's glory comes from deep delight in all that he is. This means that God gets the praise and we get the pleasure. God created us so that he is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in him.</p>
