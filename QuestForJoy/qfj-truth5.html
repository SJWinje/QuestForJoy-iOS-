<p><strong>5) God sent his only son Jesus to provide eternal life and joy</strong></p>

<p><em>"Here is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance: Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners..."</em> (1 Timothy 1:15)</p>

<p>The good news is that Christ died for sinners like us. And he rose physically from the dead to validate the saving power of his death and to open the gates of eternal life and joy (1 Corinthians 15:20). This means God can acquit guilty sinners and still be just (Romans 3:25-26). "For Christ died for sins once for all, the righteous for the unrighteous, to bring us to God" (1 Peter 3:18). Coming home to God is where all deep and lasting satisfaction is found.</p>
